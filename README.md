# Bayes_Beta_Binomial_Prop_Shiny_App

This is a Shiny app I created to illustrate how the poserior distribution (computed using a Beta prior and Bernoulli Likelihood) changes in response to the data and hyperparameters.   

You can find the app at https://justinstrate.shinyapps.io/BayesBinomialProportion/
